Post-Generation Instructions:\n
\n
In order to utilize the generated SystemACE collection it is necessary to take 
further manual steps.\n
\n
1. copy the resultant collection folder and xilinx.sys file to the SystemACE compact 
flash via your OS.\n
2. set jumper settings on the development board to utilize the SystemACE loader.\n
For ML605:\n
\t- set S1 switch 4 to ON.\n
\t- set S1 switches 1-3 to the desired image in the collection, 0-7.\n
\t\t- S1 switch 1 is the least significant bit\n
\t\t- S1 switch 3 is the most significant bit\n
\t- power cycle or press S3 to reload the image.\n
\t- See "ML605 Hardware User Guide", UG534, for more detailed information.\n
For SP605:\n
\t- set SW1 switch M[1] to ON and switch M[0] to OFF\n
\t- set S1 switch 4 to ON.\n
